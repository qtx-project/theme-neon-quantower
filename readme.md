Welcome to the `Quantower Neon Theme` project! This repository
  contains a custom theme for Quantower, designed to bring a neon
  style to the interface. It transforms the application's appearance
  by adding bright colors while maintaining readability and clarity.

This theme is my personal theme that I use on a daily basis in Quantower.
  I created it to add a touch of neon color while remaining functional
  and pleasing to the eye. It's totally open-source and licensed under
  [GPL-3.0 License](./license.txt), so you can use it, modify it and adapt
  it to your needs.

## Important Note

This theme is currently in **beta**. Updates will likely be made 
  progressively based on my personal needs and preferences. However, 
  any relevant suggestions are welcome, as long as they align with 
  the theme's vision (style improvements, visual enhancements, etc.).
  Feel free to open **issues**!
