# Security Policy

This project is essentially a collection of CSS files (SASS to be precise), 
  so it doesn't contain any server-side logic, databases, or JavaScript 
  code that could introduce security vulnerabilities.

### Potential Risks

- The only risk you might face is changing a variable in the file and 
  accidentally destroying the aesthetic harmony of your theme. But don't 
  worry, it's much easier to fix than an XSS vulnerability! ðŸ˜œ
